      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I got my first dog in 1980. It was a German shepherd female called Biba. We learned a lot together. With the help of books about training, I taught her all obedience exercises. In 1989 I got another pedigree German shepherd male, Lux II. Golobov. We attended exhibitions and trained obedience, track and attack exercisess. We achieved SchH II. After mating Lux with bitch I got a German shepherd female, Nella Golobova. We reached the highest level in training dogs – SchH III. We also used to join working dog competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that I wanted something different, new, a special dog with unique character. I liked Siberian husky not only for its appearance but also for its character. I bought myself a bitch – Dadra Ojimi – Dedra. She represented the beginning of a new way in training and breeding dogs. I taught her obedience. I had two other females for shows and breeding. They both have the highest exam in obedience. I and my huskies showed what it can be achieved if only you work hard enough, have will and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a certified canine behaviourist, I believe in ethical breeding practices, positive-reinforcement training, and giving every dog the best possible start in life.<br><br>
